        Welcome to Bicicletando! This site is about a project called Bicicletar © which is based in Fortaleza-CE, Brazil. The purpose of this site is to inform tourists from abroad that are currently in town or just anyone interested, really, about the project and how it works. 
        The official site for the project is fully in Portuguese, as the target users are the people who live in the city itself and local tourists. Having said so site is an attempt to explain in English some of the most relevant information.
        Okay! So let's start with an exert from the Official site about the project:
        “The Sistema Bicicleta is composed by smart stations, connected to a center of operations working with wireless technology, powered by solar energy and that spreads through various strategic points in the city, where the Clients that have signed up are able to take a bike, use it and return it on the same, or other station”.
        Still on the official website we read about the desired goals for the project, which are:
        •	Introduct the bike as a healthy and non-polluting mean of public transportation.
        •	Fight the population's sedentarism and promote the practice of healthier habits.
        •	Reduce the traffic jams and environmental pollution in the central areas of the cities.
        •	Promote the humanization of the urban environment and the social responsibility of the people.
        About the stations:
        •	Computer managed;
        •	Solar energy use and wireless communication;
        •	Panel with use instructions and a map with the location of the stations
        •	Stations with different designs 
        •	Electromechanical features for locking and releasing the bike.
        •	Signaling lights
        •	Bike releasing through smart applications for cellphones.

        There are some great places to bike in Fortaleza. Since this site is about how to use the bikes, we will cover some of the places tourists would like to know during their stay.
        -	First: Beira Mar (h2)
        Beira-Mar is a really well-known avenue that, goes along the shore. There are a lot of buildings, hotels, restaurants, sport courts and etc., that make up the complexity and beauty of this unique part of the city. There is also a famous flea market called “Feirinha da Beira-Mar”, which is held almost everyday at night. The view of the setting sun with the boats ashore and the people going about their lives in the sidewalk, be it working or just trying to have a good time, is absolutely mesmerizing yet relaxing at the same time. 
        -	Second: Parque do Cocó
        This is the largest natural park in urban area in the North and Northeast of Brazil and the fourth largest in Latin America. It spans across 15 districts and has millenary dunes at it’s borders. The name comes from the river that crosses it: “Rio Cocó”. It also has two options of boat trips, a shorter one, that takes around 20 minutes and a much lengthy one, that sails to the sea and back, which takes around 2 hours.
