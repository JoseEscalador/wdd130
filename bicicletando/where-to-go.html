            <h2> Beira-Mar </h2>
            <p>	Beira-Mar is a really well-known avenue that, goes along the shore. There are a lot of buildings, hotels, restaurants, sport courts and etc., that make up the complexity and beauty of this unique part of the city. There is also a famous flea market called “Feirinha da Beira-Mar”, which is held almost everyday at night. The view of the setting sun with the boats ashore and the people going about their lives in the sidewalk, be it working or just trying to have a good time, is absolutely mesmerizing yet relaxing at the same time.
